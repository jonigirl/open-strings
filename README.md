# Open Strings

_Customize Star Citizen's localization strings._

> **Maintenance mode** — v1.2.0 is the final feature release. Security and critical bug fixes only.

## Fork notice

Open Strings is a fork of [Smart Citizen by Osiris DevWorks](https://github.com/Osiris-DevWorks/smart-citizen), modified by Joni Hayes. Distributed under GPL-3.0-only.

## Features

- **Multi-channel support** — LIVE / PTU / EPTU / HOTFIX / TECH-PREVIEW each get an isolated workspace (independent `user.ini`, cache, backups, DataForge extraction, enhancement INIs).
- **Sourced from Data.p4k** — stock localization and DataForge entity data are unpacked directly from your installed game; no community mirrors, no network needed.
- **Inline editing with live preview** — double-click any cell to edit; preview pane renders loc-tokens (line breaks, EM3/EM4 emphasis, mission placeholders) as styled HTML.
- **Auto-generated enhancements** — stat overlays for ships, components, weapons, missions, journal entries, and commodity crafting; togglable per category.
- **Safe apply** — timestamped backups before every write, automatic rollback on validation mismatch, up to 5 backups per channel.

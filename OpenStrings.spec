    # `scripts/generate_enhancements_ini.py` is bundled as a data file (not
    # analyzed as a Python module), so PyInstaller doesn't follow its
    # imports. Without this hint its `from src.utils.progress_sink import
    # ProgressSink` silently hits the `except ImportError: _sink = None`
    # branch in the frozen build and the Generate Enhancements run shows an
    # indeterminate bar the whole time even though the determinate-progress
    # plumbing is otherwise intact. dataforge_patcher survives by accident
    # because main_window.py also imports it for apply_patches; listed here
    # as belt + suspenders so a future main_window refactor can't break it.
    # `concurrent.futures` is a stdlib subpackage used directly by
    # generate_enhancements_ini.py; PyInstaller doesn't include it
    # automatically when the script is a data file rather than an analyzed
    # module, causing a ModuleNotFoundError at enhancements generation time.
    # `xml.etree.ElementTree` is also required by generate_enhancements_ini.py
    # for parsing DataForge XML. It was previously pulled in indirectly via
    # dataforge_patcher.py, which was switched to lxml in 1.3.0, leaving
    # xml.etree with no analyzed reference and breaking enhancements generation.
    # The enhancement generator was refactored to import formatter/helpers from
    # src.utils modules, so those imports must also be listed here because the
    # generator is bundled as data and not analyzed directly.

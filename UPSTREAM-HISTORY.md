# 0.8.x Final Mission, Crafting, & Commodity Detail Enhancements

## 0.8.0

- [x] complete enhancements & fixes for missions
- [x] complete enhancements & fixes for crafting
- [x] complete enhancements & fixes for commodity details
- [x] mission enhancements: spawn counts (waves/enemies/non-hostiles), difficulty rating, flags (Chain, Starter, Unique), contract template lookups
- [x] stats separator changed from `== Stats ==` to `<EM3>STATS</EM3>` / `<EM3>MISSION DETAILS</EM3>` for cleaner in-game rendering
- [x] filter out components with placeholder overheat temp (450,000K)
- [x] 16 mission enhancement tests added with CSV fixture (1,288 missions) for cross-validation
- [x] stability & bugfixes
- [x] end-to-end testing & version release

## 0.8.1 Mission Annotation Fixes & Performance

- [x] Stanton Bounty Hunter missions (VLRT/LRT/MRT/HRT/ERT) show descriptions — contracts sharing a title but different desc keys each get their own stats block
- [x] blueprint list restored for `[BP]`/`[BP*]` missions (215 missions now show POTENTIAL BLUEPRINTS)
- [x] templated cargo-haul titles (Junior/Master Rank Direct Bulk Cargo Haul) show XP ranges via `ContractResult_CalculatedReward` fallback to pu_missions aggregation
- [x] CleanAir bulk hauls pick up XP via `ContractResult_ScenarioProgress PointsToAward` fallback
- [x] remove aUEC reward line from descriptions (game shows it natively)
- [x] annotation styling: `<EM3>`/`<EM4>` for missions/commodities/journal; plain text + `--- STATS ---` for ship/component/weapon items (EM tags don't render there); title XP tags now `<EM4>`-wrapped
- [x] performance: merged magazine and entity-name walks over `entities/scitem/` into one pass (~20k XMLs scanned once, saves ~30s per run)
- [x] performance: disk-cached derived lookups under `cache\dataforge\.lookups\` keyed on P4K mtime; warm stats-gen runs 100s+ → ~9.5s
- [x] installer: uninstall preserves `Documents\SC Localization Editor\backups\`
- [x] portable onefile exe retired — installer-only going forward

## 0.8.2 Bug Fixes

- [x] when a user provides a different Star Citizen installation path during setup, it isn't being propagated to the game settings — `get_game_install_path()` now mirrors the installer-written `sc_directory` into QSettings on first read, so the app survives registry cleanup or clean reinstall
- [x] what is with the BP* annotations? — intentional marker for "only some mission variants reward BP" (14 of 233 BP-annotated missions, ~6%). Descriptions already list the specific variants; added a footer line `* = only some mission variants reward bp`to`[BP*]` mission descriptions so the asterisk is self-explanatory.

# 0.9.0 Pre-Release Polish

- [x] UI themes: dark, light, SCLE and ODW themes
- [x] Rebranding as "Smart Citizen: Smarter Strings for Star Citizen"
- [x] Fix sorting of favorites column
- [x] ship armor enhancements — `entities/scitem/ships/armor/` (~197 XMLs, ~100 loc keys in base.ini). Damage multipliers (physical/energy/distortion/thermal), deflection, health pools. Reuses the weapon-damage parsing pattern; output as `ship_armor_desc_enhancements.ini` merged as a new source.

## 0.9.1

- [x] default theme progress bar is all solid and doesn't animate — retuned SCLE `Highlight` from near-max #00D4FF to #0099CC so Fusion's chunk gradient has room to animate
- [x] progress bars for other themes the two colors are too similar — shifted each theme's `Highlight` to mid-luminance (Light #1565C0, Dark #3B82F6, ODW #D4A017) so the chunk gradient's lighter/darker tones read distinctly
- [x] use better contrast on text for light and dark themes — palette disabled/placeholder tuned; secondary-text role retargeted per-theme (Light #2A2A2A, Dark/SCLE #D5D5D5, ODW #D4B876) via an app-level QSS rule
- [x] when first starting and generation says files are missing, it says 8 but lists only 6 — dialog now counts the category checkboxes it actually renders, not the underlying files
- [x] when generating stats, the footer at one point says "Ready" which is confusing because its actually still working — status bar no longer falls back to "Ready" while any extract/generate/load worker is running
- [x] Jorrit Dossier P2M1/P2M4 share blueprint awards — game-side data bug (P2M4's contract references `P2M1_Repeat_desc`); first-writer-wins guard keeps P2M1's intended pool (Pool A, 11 items). Also extended contract-template fallback so `desc_key` resolves independently of `title_key`.

## 0.9.2

- [x] parallelize enhancements generation + switch to determinate progress bars
- [x] Bounty missions from the BHG in Stanton system that do not give BPs are getting BP tag in titles — title tag now skips `[BP?]` when any desc_key bucket under that title has no BP-having variant
- [x] Issue with P2M1/P2M4 blueprints not resolved — declarative DataForge patch rewrites P2M4_Repeat's Description param from the bugged `@Hockrow_FacilityDelve_P2M1_Repeat_desc` to `@Hockrow_FacilityDelve_P2M4_Repeat_desc`
- [x] Regional blueprint awards are not showing properly for their region — `mission_blueprints` now tracks per-system pools
- [x] Add Battlestations to other apps in about section
- [x] Add/Update acknowledgements section
- [x] finalize in-app documentation
- [x] missiles missing type tag [CM/EM/IF]
- [x] all Wikelo ships should be classified as ships
- [x] Aluminum not getting [CF] tag when viewed in FE inventory
- [x] Hex Shield Generator not getting its annotations
- [x] Hockrow mission with icebox fresnel reward not showing that reward
- [x] Extreme Risk Target Mission showing [BP?]
- [x] Move in-app help to standalone `HELP.md`
- [x] Convert Help dialog into a dockable side-panel
- [x] Restyle the Help button to match the toolbar
- [x] Drop outdated remote-download wording from `ABOUT.md` and `HELP.md`
- [x] Add a `USER_DATA_DIR` registry override for OneDrive users
- [x] Rename QSettings registry node from legacy `SC Localization Editor` to `Smart Citizen`
- [x] Installer detects OneDrive-redirected Documents folder
- [x] Guard against CIG system-sentinel loc-keys (`LOC_UNINITIALIZED` etc.)

## 0.9.3 RC1

- [x] Investigated headhunters `EliminateSpecific_Asteroid_Generic_M` [BP] false positive — could not reproduce; audited all 231 `[BP]`-tagged titles, zero gaps found
- [x] Declarative loc-string workarounds for CIG contract-reference bugs (`patches/*.patch.json` `locstring_workarounds` list)
- [x] Known Issues section in `HELP.md` documenting CIG-side bugs
- [x] Better formatting for Help section — fixed Markdown bold/italic rendering in `markdown_to_html()`
- [x] Tooltips for all buttons and UI elements
- [x] Guided tutorial — interactive coach-mark tour (`src/gui/coach_mark.py`, `assets/tutorial.json`)
- [x] Cache streamlining — DataForge cache now holds only the subtrees the enhancement generator reads (~52% fewer files, ~42% smaller)
- [x] Performance optimization — `extract_category()` lru_cache, `_get_canonical_key()` short-circuit + lru_cache, validation double-parse eliminated
- [x] Per-channel Star Citizen install support (LIVE / PTU / EPTU / TECH-PREVIEW), isolated workspaces per channel
- [x] Consolidated Feedback, Bug Reports, and Feature Request Voting into a single Discord channel

# 1.1.0 Smart Citizen — post-production

> The following changes were released in Smart Citizen v1.1.0 by Osiris DevWorks.
> Items marked **[ported]** were merged into Open Strings 1.1.2.
> Items marked **[held]** were not ported; reasons noted.

- [x] Radar name tags: `scan_entity_dir` called with `generate_name_tags=True` for radar components, adding `[CLASS-S{size}-{grade}]` annotations matching other component types **[ported]**
- [x] Radar sibling-key propagation: `"RADR"` added to `comp_types` so radar stat blocks copy from `_SCItem` keys to non-SCItem siblings **[ported]**
- [x] Fix Custom Value cell editor erasing content on double-click: `EditRole` handling added to `StringTableModel.data()` **[ported]**
- [x] Fix Generate Enhancements wiping pending edits: snapshot/restore of un-Applied in-memory edits across reload paths **[ported]**
- [ ] Editor Side-Panel — held for Open Strings 1.2.0 (scope too large for a patch)
- [ ] Journal timestamp annotations — held pending user decision on format

# 1.2.0 Smart Citizen — Faster First-Run + Upgrade Reliability

> The following changes were released in Smart Citizen v1.2.0 by Osiris DevWorks.
> Items marked **[ported]** were merged into Open Strings 1.1.2.
> Items marked **[held]** were not ported; reasons noted.

- [x] Fix upgrade uninstall race: installer waits for old uninstaller's registry-key deletion before proceeding to file copy, and shows a distinct "Uninstalling previous version..." step with a marquee progress bar **[ported]**
- [x] Fix table column headers vanishing until restart after transient layout passes (theme swap, dock toggle, splitter drag, font load): header now always paints at its base height regardless of the transient rect **[ported]**
- [ ] Faster DataForge conversion via optimized unforge build (~5× improvement, ~23× on Save phase) — not applicable; Open Strings downloads unp4k/unforge from the upstream dolkensp/unp4k release at runtime rather than bundling a custom build
- [ ] Update "5–10 minutes" UI text to "a few minutes" — held pending hardware verification; still accurate for some machines on our toolchain

# 1.3.0 Smart Citizen — Mission Intel + Portable Build

> The following changes were released in Smart Citizen v1.3.0 by Osiris DevWorks.
> Items marked **[ported]** were merged into Open Strings 1.1.3.
> Items marked **[held]** were not ported; reasons noted.

- [x] Engagement Type in MISSION DETAILS block: classifies each mission as `FPS`, `Ship`, or `FPS & Ship` from CIG's loc-key naming convention (`_FPS_`, `_UGF_`, `_OnFoot_`) plus cargo/salvage/freight tokens that indicate a transport phase **[ported]**
- [x] Turrets in MISSION DETAILS block: sums spawn-data turret count and surfaces the explicit hostility flag when CIG sets one; defaults to "hostile" when absent **[ported]**
- [x] "Enhanced" status badge: Status column now distinguishes user edits (Modified, green #4CAF50) from enhancements-pipeline rows (Enhanced, blue #2196F3); filter combo and tooltip updated accordingly **[ported]**
- [x] Export Loc-Pack button: packages the currently-applied global.ini as a channel-named zip for sharing (e.g. `OpenStrings-LocPack-LIVE-20260512.zip`), defaulting to the Downloads folder **[ported]**
- [x] Tutorial Skip is now permanent across versions: dismissing the tour once suppresses it for all future releases **[ported]**
- [x] Fix toolbar drift: preview pane height cap lowered from 200 px to 120 px and a `Preferred` size policy added so the toolbar row stays a constant height across all tabs **[ported]**
- [ ] Portable build (settings, cache, and backups in a `data/` folder next to the .exe; zero registry footprint) — held; Open Strings uses the Windows registry by design and there is no user demand for a portable mode
- [ ] Apache 2.0 relicence and NOTICE file — not applicable; Open Strings is GPL-3.0-only
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, auto-release on merge to main, Discord notification) — held; solo project with manual releases
- [ ] Major main-window refactor (~600-line extraction to helpers and workers) — not applicable; the modular split this was based on originated in Open Strings and was adapted back upstream in v1.3.0

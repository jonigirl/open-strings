"""Apply declarative JSON patches to DataForge-extracted XML files.

Background: Star Citizen's game data occasionally ships with bugs that affect
our localization enhancements — e.g. a Contract record whose Description param
points at the wrong loc-key. Rather than working around each bug downstream,
we patch the DataForge cache itself immediately after extraction, so every
downstream consumer (the enhancement generator, future tooling) sees corrected
data without needing to know.

Patches live under the repo's ``patches/`` directory, mirroring the DataForge
layout under ``dataforge/raw/libs/foundry/records/``. Each patch is a JSON
file with ``*.patch.json`` suffix describing the target file, a short
description, and a list of edits.

Example patch (patches/contracts/.../hockrowagency_facilitydelve.patch.json):

    {
      "target": "contracts/contractgenerator/mercenary_guild/hockrowagency/hockrowagency_facilitydelve.xml",
      "description": "Fix P2M4_Repeat desc-key reference (CIG bug: points to P2M1's desc)",
      "edits": [
        {
          "xpath": ".//Contract[@debugName='Hockrow_FacilityDelve_P2M4-Stanton4_Repeat']//ContractStringParam[@param='Description']",
          "attribute": "value",
          "expected": "@Hockrow_FacilityDelve_P2M1_Repeat_desc",
          "set": "@Hockrow_FacilityDelve_P2M4_Repeat_desc"
        }
      ]
    }

Each edit asserts the current value matches ``expected`` before rewriting.
If it doesn't match, the edit is skipped with a warning — this protects
against CIG-side fixes (if they correct the bug upstream, our patch just
becomes a no-op instead of blindly overwriting the corrected value).

Patches are idempotent: if the target already holds ``set``, the edit is
skipped cleanly and not counted as a mismatch.

A patch file may also declare a ``locstring_workarounds`` list. Each entry
appends one loc key's value onto another — useful when CIG's bug is in a
contract's Description *pointer* (so the game looks up the wrong loc key at
runtime) and our XML edit only realigns the enhancement-generator's
bookkeeping. Merging the intended desc onto the loc key the game actually
reads makes the in-game display correct. See :class:`LocstringWorkaround`
and :func:`apply_locstring_workarounds`.

    The XML edits in this module fix our local DataForge cache so the

    Citizen resolves contract references against its own ``Data.p4k``, which
    still contains the bugged Title/Description pointer. A locstring
    workaround sidesteps that by merging the *intended* desc's content into
    the loc key the game actually looks up, so an in-game contract whose
    Description param points at the wrong key still displays the correct
    content.

    Loses nothing when the upstream bug is fixed — delete the workaround
    declaration (or the whole patch file) and the next regenerate produces
    clean split descs again.

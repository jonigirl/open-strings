    Checks that every key in base.ini is present in the written file.
    Values are allowed to differ. Extra keys (from components/contracts/
    commodities sources) are expected and not treated as errors.

    Args:
        written_path: Path to the global.ini just written to the game directory.
        cache_dir: Path to the application cache directory (used to locate
            base.ini when stock_keys is not provided).
        stock_keys: Optional pre-parsed set of base.ini keys. If provided,
            skips a redundant parse — callers that already have base.ini in
            memory should pass it here. The written-file parse always runs as
            independent verification.

    Returns:
        Empty string if validation passed, or a human-readable warning message
        describing any missing or unexpected keys.
